   	    <dd> Since my school days I used to get puzzled by the line spectrum of Hydrogen atom. Bohr's model says that the electron absorbs the light of a particular frequency whose energy matches with the energy gap of the orbits. But younger me couldn't understand why more energetic photons are not able to cause the transition. It was not until I read the time dependent perturbation theory when I got a satisfactory answer through the regorous quantum mechanics. In this article I have shown how that result is obtained from TDP theory.
