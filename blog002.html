<h3 style="color:  black;"><a href = "blog001.html" style = "color:black;" >An apparent inconsistency in the atomic transition</a></h3>
<p align = "justify"> 
Quantum theory of atoms even the Bohr model suggests that the electrons can't possess any random energy, rather the atomic orbitals are very specific and discontinuous. Moreover, the locomotion of the electrons from one energy state to another is carried out either by absorption of energy or emission of the same in the form of electro-magnetic radiation(s). It's a well know fact that, an electron jumps from higher energy states to a lower energy state, a photon of frequency <script type="math/tex">\nu</script> is emitted and according to quantum mechanics the frequency (<script type="math/tex">\nu</script>) is related to the energy difference as,
</p>
<p align = "center">
<script type="math/tex; mode= display">
E_{high} - E_{low} = h\nu
</script>
</p>
<p align = "justify">	
Similarly, an electron transit from a lower energy state to a higher energy state by absorbing a photon of energy<script type="math/tex">  </script> h\nu</script>, complying with the same relation. While the first case is quite persuadable, the second one raise one simple doubt, <b>what if we incident a light of frequency <script type="math/tex">\nu_1</script> much larger than the required frequency?</b> A simple mind would intuit that it's more likely for a higher energy photon to cause the excitation than a photon of energy same as the excitation energy, but it's not true. The question is <b>why?</b>
</p>
<p align = "justify">
Well, the explanation involves little advanced quantum mechanics ( the word 'advanced' has been used in relative sense ) to be more specific <em>time dependent perturbation theory</em> (TDPT). Here it is,

Let's consider there are only two eigen states where  the electron can be, namely <script type="math/tex"> \psi_a</script> and <script type="math/tex">\psi_b</script>,  and the non-perturbed Hamiltonian be <script type="math/tex"> \hat{H_0}</script>. So, according to the time independent Schrodinger equation,
</p>
<p align = "center">
<script type="math/tex;" align = "left">
\hat{H_0}\psi_a = E_a\psi_a \hspace{2cm} \hat{H_0}\psi_b = E_b\psi_b
</script>
</p>
<p align = "justify">
Needless to say<script type="math/tex">  </script> <script type="math/tex">E_a</script> and <script type="math/tex"> E_b</script> are interpreted as energies of the states<script type="math/tex"> \psi_a </script> and <script type="math/tex"> \psi_b</script> respectively. If, the electron starts with any of the stationary states, it will stay as it is. But if it's a linear combination of those two states, i.e.
</p>
<p align = "center">
<script type="math/tex;" align = "left">
\psi(0) = c_a\psi_a + c_b\psi_b
</script>
</p>
<p align = "justify">
then, the state evolves with time, complying with the following relation,
</p>
<p align = "center">
<script type="math/tex;" align = "left">
\psi(t) = c_a\psi_a e^{-iE_at/\hbar} + c_b\psi_be^{-iE_bt/\hbar}
</script>
</p>
<p align = "justify">

the coefficients <script type="math/tex">c_a</script> and <script type="math/tex">c_b</script> are not necessarily constant. Now, if we introduce a <em>time dependent perturbation</em> in the potential <script type="math/tex">V</script>,  the resultant Hamiltonian would be, 
</p>
<p align = "center">
<script type="math/tex;" align = "left">
\hat{H} = \hat{H_0} + \hat{H'}(t)
</script>
</p>
<p align = "justify">

The time dependent nature of the Hamiltonian makes the coefficients, <script type="math/tex">c_a</script> and <script type="math/tex"> c_b</script> change with time as well and the relation is the following ( sorry to state it directly, the derivation would just make the discussion cumbersome),
</p>
<p align = "center">
<script type="math/tex;" align = "left">
{\frac{dc_a}{dt} = -\frac{i}{\hbar}H'_{ab}e^{-i\omega_0t}c_b \hspace{2cm} \frac{dc_b}{dt} = -\frac{i}{\hbar}H'_{ba}e^{-i\omega_0t}c_a}
</script>
</p>
<p align = "justify">

Where, 
</p>

<p align = "center">
<script type="math/tex;">
H'_{ab}\equiv <\psi_a|H'|\psi_b> \hspace{2cm} H'_{ba}\equiv <\psi_b|H'|\psi_a>
</script>
</p>
<p align = "justify">
and, 
</p>
<p align = "center">
<script type="math/tex;" align = "left">
\omega_0 = \frac{E_b - E_a}{\hbar}
</script>
</p>
<p align = "justify">



One thing to notice is that the equation (8) is a coupled differential equation. A good starting point to unravel the usefulness of the above equation would be considering <script type="math/tex">c_a = 1</script> and <script type="math/tex">c_b = 0</script>, i.e. assuming the electron starts from the state <script type="math/tex">\psi_a</script>. Substituting the value of <script type="math/tex">c_a</script> and <script type="math/tex">c_b</script> in equation <script type="math/tex">\eqref{eq:TDPT}</script> the first order correction would be, 

</p>
<p align = "center">
<script type="math/tex;" align = "left">
\frac{dc_a^{(1)}}{dt} = 0,\implies c_a^{(1)}(t) = 1 \\
\frac{dc_b^{(1)}}{dt} = -\frac{i}{\hbar}H'_{ba}e^{i\omega_0t} \implies c_b^{(1)}= -\frac{i}{\hbar}\int_0^t H'_{ba}(t')e^{i\omega_0t'}dt'
</script>
</p>
<p align = "justify">
substituting equation (9) again in equation (8), we get the second order correction and continuing in this manner we get all the higher order correction due to the perturbed time dependent potential. So, the formalism is done for now, let's focus on our specific problem, a perturbation caused by incident light (or EM wave).

For the sake of simplicity, we will assume that the incident wave is sinusoidal which introduces a cosine perturbation ( as, <script type="math/tex">E = -\nabla V</script> ), i.e.

</p>
<p align = "center">
<script type="math/tex;" align = "left">
H'(\mathbf{r},t) = V(\mathbf{r})\cos{(\omega t)}
</script>
</p>
<p align = "justify">
so that, 

</p>
<p align = "center">
<script type="math/tex;" align = "left">
H'_{ab} = V_{ab}\cos{(\omega t)}
</script>
</p>
<p align = "justify">

where, 

</p>
<p align = "center">
<script type="math/tex;" align = "left">
V_{ab} \equiv <\psi_a|V(\mathbf{r})|\psi_b>
</script>
</p>
<p align = "justify">

Note that, <script type="math/tex">\omega</script> is nothing but the angular frequency of the incident photon/light wave. Performing the integration as dictated in equation (9) with limit 0 to t, we get,

</p>
<p align = "center">
<script type="math/tex;" align = "left">
c_b(t) \approx - \frac{V_{ba}}{2\hbar}\left[\frac{e^{i(\omega_0 + \omega)t} - 1}{\omega_0 + \omega} + \frac{e^{i(\omega_0 - \omega)t} - 1}{\omega_0 - \omega} \right]
</script>
</p>
<p align = "justify">

This may seem complicated but, physicists have an excellent tool to simplify stuffs, it's called approximation. Since we already know the fact that the emission/ absorption takes place when <script type="math/tex">\omega</script> is roughly same as <script type="math/tex">\omega_0</script>, it is sufficient to investigate the effect of the perturbation for <script type="math/tex">\omega \approx \omega_0 </script>. So that,

</p>
<p align = "center">
<script type="math/tex;" align = "left">
|\omega_0 + \omega| >>|\omega_0 - \omega|
</script>
</p>
<p align = "justify">

which encourages us to neglect the first term inside the square bracket. Now, the expression becomes,

</p>
<p align = "center">
<script type="math/tex;" align = "left">
c_b(t) \approx - \frac{V_{ba}}{2\hbar}\left[ \frac{e^{i(\omega_0 - \omega)t} - 1}{\omega_0 - \omega} \right] = -i\frac{V_{ba}}{\hbar}\frac{\sin{\left[(\omega_0 - \omega)t/2\right]}}{\omega_0 - \omega}
</script>
</p>
<p align = "justify">

A remarkable result indeed. What <script type="math/tex"> c_b</script> tells us is how likely the electron to be found in the state <script type="math/tex">\psi_b</script>. So, assuming the wave function to be normalised, the probability of finding the electron in the state<script type="math/tex">\psi_b</script> is simply, 

</p>
<p align = "center">
<script type="math/tex;" align = "left">
P = |c_b|^2 \approx \frac{|V_{ab}|^2}{\hbar^2}\frac{\sin^2{\left[(\omega_0 - \omega)\right]t/2}}{(\omega_0 - \omega)^2}
</script>
</p>
<p align = "justify">

Now, if you remember, we started with the state <script type="math/tex">\psi_a</script> only, and we are getting a positive probability for the electron to be in state <script type="math/tex">\psi_b</script>. In other words, there is a chance of transition from the state <script type="math/tex">\psi_a</script> to <script type="math/tex">\psi_b</script>. That's why <script type="math/tex">P</script> is called transition probability. But did we get our answer? No, we will if we plot the transition probability vs <script type="math/tex"> \omega </script> graph. In the figure below, you can easily see that the transition probability is much larger at the vicinity of the <script type="math/tex"> \omega_0</script>. That explains why the transition is caused by mostly the light of a certain wavelength. Another interesting point to be noted is that, the graph is symmetric, so if you are little brave you would say, that an EM wave having less frequency than <script type="math/tex">\omega_0</script> is also capable of causing the excitation. Really!!

Another doubt may come to your mind regarding the transition probability, In our assumption there was nothing special about the states, we didn't mention which states is the lower energy state, and which one is higher. So, this analysis is also applicable for the transition from higher energy state to lower energy state, and an emission happens due to presence of radiation. These phenomena are called <em>stimulated emission</em> and it explains why the electron goes from higher energy states to lower energy states. But it again raise an annoying question, if the electron is already in higher stationary state and the whole system is kept in dark, i.e. in the absence of radiation, will the transition still happen? The answer is yes, and it was known as spontaneous emission. But isn't it against the law of quantum mechanics? No, because there is nothing as purely spontaneous emission, without perturbation, the electron would stay in the higher energy state forever. However in <em>quantum electrodynamics</em> the fields are nonzero even in the ground state, just like the ground state energy of the harmonic oscillator is nonzero. So, whatever you do, wherever you go, there will always be radiation to cause the perturbation and will encourage the electron to break its commitment to the excited state.

I had this doubt since my school days, and finally got the explanation while reading <em>time dependent perturbation theory</em> from Griffith's Quantum Mechanics book. I have skipped the derivations to keep this discussion short, if you want you can read the Chapter 9 of the book in the reference section. In case you find any mistake in the above discussion, please let me know.
