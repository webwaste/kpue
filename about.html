<h4> About this blog</h4>
<p align = "justify"> This blog was created during the lockdown period of 2020. Everyone around me was doing something creative, mostly drawing, and musical stuffs. Being an extremely talentless person, I decided to write this blog. I can't promise that I will post anything in future, but I will try to. Currently I have no idea what this blog is about, it could be about interesting physical phenomena, or my opinion about certain things or may end up being a personal diary. It was just a desperate move. Forgive me.
