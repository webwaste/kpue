<h2 class="profile">About Me</h2>
<p>I am Hiranmay, a research scholar at Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore pursuing my interest in condensed matter theory. I am broadly interested in the quantum mechanical phenomena in condensed matter systems. Currenlty I am working on random pi-flux model and investigating the effect of flux disorder on Dirac Fermions.
