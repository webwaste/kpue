<p style="color:rgb(100,100,100);" align = "justify"> Since my school days we all knew that electrons jump from lower energy states to higher energy states by absorbing light of a certain frequency which is related to the energy difference of the states in the question. Although I was convinced that a minimum amount of energy is required for that, but didn't get any satisfactory answer on why it's not caused by light of higher frequency. I hope this answer will please you.
