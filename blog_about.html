<h2 class="blog-about">About the blogs</h2>
	<p>The first time I thought of writing blogs and hosting my own website was in 2020 summer when the whole world was kind of frozen due to COVID. My courses were alse halted and I had plenty of time for doing stuffs that feels good but won't help in my academics. So, I wrote an article on atomic transition as I was very impressed by the results of time dependent perturbation theory. I shared this blog with very few of my friends as I knew that I am not going to write frequently and the quality of neither the website nor the blog were impressive. After that blog I didn't write anything until I decied to make my own personal website. It was summer of 2022 and I got PhD offer from IISc Bangalore and again got some time to spend on this. In the process I learned little bit of html and css. Again I don't know how frquently I will write something on this blog. But I will try not to procrastinate.
